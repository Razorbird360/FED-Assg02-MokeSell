# FED Assignment 2 (MokeSell)
MokeSell is an online marketplace where users can buy and sell second-hand items with ease. After signing up for an account, users can interact directly with each other through chats to discuss offers and negotiate deals. The platform allows users to browse listings, post their own items for sale, and view detailed product descriptions and seller reviews, helping them make informed and confident decisions. Users can also edit their profiles and customize their experience. Additionally, MokeSell offers an engaging 3D game where users can explore, earn points, and redeem rewards such as vouchers or spin a lucky wheel for exciting prizes.

```shell
npm run dev
```
> Used to run project locally. Alternatively, "npx vite" to run project, but it does not guarantee consistency with locally installed versions

```shell
npm run build
npm run serve
```
> Run build for production ready version & serve to preview the Web App

## Design Process  
We wanted to provide an intuitive user experience while being aesthetic 
- As a buyer, I want to create an account so that I can start browsing and purchasing items.
- As a seller, I want to create a listing for an item so that I can offer it for sale to other users.
- As a seller, I want to upload photos of my item so that buyers can see the product clearly.
- As a buyer, I want to chat with a seller so that I can ask questions and discuss offers before making a purchase.
- As a user, I want to be able to view product descriptions and seller reviews so that I can make an informed decision before buying.
- As a seller, I want to promote my listings by bumping them so that they appear higher in search results.
- As a buyer, I want to save listings that interest me so that I can come back and view them later.
- As a user, I want to edit my profile so that I can keep my account details up-to-date.
- As a user, I want to access a 3D game where I can explore and earn points so that I can have fun and redeem rewards.
- As a buyer or seller, I want to leave a review for a transaction so that I can share my experience with others.
- As a user, I want to submit feedback on the platform so that I can report any issues or suggest improvements.
