### Run project locally
```shell
npm install
```
> This installs Three.js, Cannon-es & Vite

```shell
npm run dev
```
> Used to run project locally. Alternatively, "npx vite" to run project, but it does not guarantee consistency with locally installed versions

```shell
npm run build
npm run serve
```
> Run build for production ready version & serve to preview the Web App
